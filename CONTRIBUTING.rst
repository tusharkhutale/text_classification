Pull Request Process
====================

Please consider the following criterions in order to help us in a better way:

1. The pull request is mainly expected to be a link suggestion.
2. Please make sure your suggested resources are not obsolete or broken.
3. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build and creating a pull request.
4. Add comments with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the owner to merge it for you if you believe all checks are passed.
   
  Thank you!
